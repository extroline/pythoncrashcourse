# your goal:
# add code to the function below.
# The code has a parameter called num
# The goal of the function is to return a list with every EVEN number from 0 until one less than num.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
def even_numbers(num):
    # num is a positive integer greater than zero
    # return a list of all even integers from 0 until 1 less than the number
    # For example, if the number is 6, return [0,2,4]
    
    # write your code here
